// Its purpose is to simplify code. It is capitolized because it is a contructor function. In a constructor this refers to the member that invokes the current function. rawDataObj refers to the list of objects that is in the rw data array.

  /* TODONE: This cloned article still has a class of template. In our modules.css stylesheet, we should give all elements with a class of template a display of none so that our template does not display in the browser. But, we also need to make sure we're not accidentally hiding our cloned article. */
